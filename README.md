I will use django

data base: db.sqlite3 (or mysql)

Project functionality: includes the following columns: title, content, created,due_date, category, message.
After authorization or registration, the user can select the type of task, and then create the task itself (the creation date will be added automatically), assign the task validity date. In the task itself, the user can leave comments on the task.
If the task is completed or the due date is overdue, the task can be deleted.
